\begin{verse}
Whiskey, whiskey\\
The singer’s getting sore\\
We raised the roof\\
Now we’re lowering the floor\\
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more\\
When I say 1,2 you say 3,4\\
1,2,3,4\\
\vspace*{1em}
Altogether\\
Altogether gone\\
It’s now or never if you want another song\\
On and on goes the ringing of the bell\\
Off we go, this song won’t sing itself\\
So soldiers at my side\\
It’s you and me tonight\\
Whiskey, whiskey\\
The singer’s getting sore\\
We raised the roof\\
Now we’re lowering the floor\\
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more\\
When I say 1,2 you say 3,4\\
1,2,3,4\\
\vspace*{1em}
Mister moonlight\\
You gotta let ‘em play\\
If the devils wanna dance\\
Then the piper wants his pay\\
Hide me in a hiding place\\
Where good sense never goes\\
Take me to the fountain\\
Where the firewater flows\\
Find our alibies and lies\\
And lose ourselves tonight\\
\vspace*{1em}
Whiskey, whiskey\\

Now we’re lowering the floor\\
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more\\
When I say 1,2 you say 3,4\\
1,2,3,4\\
Trying to get the whole room on the dance floor\\
Is like trying to put a square peg in a round hole\\
I’m not saying it ain’t something that we shouldn’t try to do\\
Don’t do it for me though, do it for you\\
You’ve been minding your manners and behaving yourself\\
But there’s still a lot of bottles left upon the shelf\\
So wet my little whistle now and give a dog a bone\\
I can take it up a notch, can’t do it alone\\
So soldiers at my side\\
It’s you and me tonight\\

\subsection{A Pirates Life For Me}
\label{sec:orgb2f6446}
\begin{verse}
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me\\
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and loot\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot\\
Drink up me 'earties, yo ho\\
\vspace*{1em}
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me\\

Maraud and embezzle, and even high-jack\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
\vspace*{1em}
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me\\
We kindle and char, inflame and ignite\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
We burn up the city, we're really a fright\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
\vspace*{1em}
We're rascals, scoundrels, villans, and knaves\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
We're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
\vspace*{1em}
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me\\
We're beggars and blighters, ne'er-do-well cads\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\
Aye, but we're loved by our mommies and dads\\
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho\\

\subsection{Barrett's Privateers}
\label{sec:org68570d3}
\begin{verse}
[Verse 1]\\
Oh, the year was 1778\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
A letter of marque came from the king\\
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
[Verse 2]\\
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
For twenty brave men all fishermen who\\
Would make for him the Antelope's crew\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 3]\\
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags\\
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 4]\\
On the King's birthday we put to sea\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
We were 91 days to Montego Bay\\
Pumping like madmen all the way\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
[Verse 5]\\
On the 96th day we sailed again\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight\\
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 6]\\
Now the Yankee lay low down with gold\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays\\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 7]\\
Then at length we stood two cables away\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din\\
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
[Verse 8]\\
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs\\
And the Main truck carried off both me legs\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 9]\\
So here I lay in my 23rd year\\
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now\\
It's been 6 years since we sailed away\\
And I just made Halifax yesterday\\
God damn them all! I was told\\
We'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears\\
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers\\

\subsection{Beneath the Black Flag}
\label{sec:orga0c7739}
\begin{verse}
Out on the endless ocean\\
We tear along the gales\\
With rum inside our bellies warm\\
And freedom in our sails\\
\vspace*{1em}
A wayward bunch of scoundrels\\
Assassins, thieves and slaves\\
The rich and blue-bloods fear us when\\
We hunt upon the waves\\
\vspace*{1em}
And when you see it coming\\
That flag of baleful black\\
No point in turning tail there's no\\
Escaping our attack!\\
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We own the sea and sky\\
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We bleed the kingdoms dry!\\
\vspace*{1em}
Defy the odds against us\\
A pirate knows no fear\\
Our steel is ready and our\\
Retribution is severe\\
\vspace*{1em}
We plunder from the greedy\\
With blood and with our steel\\
We rob the rich of their\\
Ill-gotten gain and make them kneel\\
\vspace*{1em}
Behold the ocean's mysteries\\
The tales of ancient deeds\\
We follow in the footsteps\\
Of a silent secret creed\\
Come on, lads!\\
\vspace*{1em}
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We own the sea and sky\\
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We bleed the kingdoms dry!\\
\vspace*{1em}
Hoist the black flag, lads!\\
\vspace*{1em}
Justice runs in crimson rivers\ldots{}\\
\vspace*{1em}
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We own the sea and sky\\
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\
A rollickin' we go!\\
We own the sea and sky\\
YO-HO!\\
YO-HO!\\
We row beneath the black flag\\

We bleed the kingdoms dry!\\

Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Gather up all of the crew!\\
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!\\
Sea wind blows. To where?\\
Who knows?\\
The waves will be our guide!\\
O'er across the ocean's tide,\\
Rays of sunshine far and wide,\\
Birds they sing of cheerful things, in circles passing by!\\
Bid farewell to weaver's town!\\
Say so long to port renowned!\\
Sing a song, it won't be long, before we're casting off!\\
Cross the gold and silver seas\\
The salty spray puts us at ease!\\
Day and night to our delight,\\
The voyage never ends!\\
Gather up all of the crew!\\
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!\\
Pirates we, eternally are challenging the sea!\\
With the waves to rest our heads,\\
ship beneath us as our beds!\\
Hoisted high upon the mast our Jolly Roger flies!\\
Somewhere in the endless sky,\\
Stormy winds are blowin' by!\\
Waves are dancing, evening comes,\\
It's time to sound the drums!\\
But steady men may never fear!\\
Tomorrow's skies are always clear!\\
So pound your feet and clap your hands till sunny days return!\\
\vspace*{1em}
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Gather up all of the crew!\\
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!\\
Wave good-bye, but don't you cry\\
Our memories remain.\\
Our days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem\\
'neath the moon we'll meet again, the wind's our lullaby!\\
Gather up all of the crew!\\
It's time to ship out Bink's brew!\\
Sing a song and play along\\
For all the ocean's wide!\\
After all is said and done,\\
you'll end up a skeleton!\\
So spread your tale, from dawn till dusk, upon these foamy seas!\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho,\\
Yo-hohoho, Yo-hoho-ho.\\

\subsection{Captain Kidd}
\label{sec:org147c8c9}
\begin{verse}
My name is Captain Kidd\\
As I sailed, as I sailed,\\
Oh my name is Captain Kidd as I sailed,\\
My name is Captain Kidd\\
And God's laws I did forbid,\\
And most wickedly I did as I sailed.\\
\vspace*{1em}
My father taught me well\\
To shun the gates of hell,\\
But against him I rebelled as I sailed,\\
He shoved a bible in my hand\\
But I left it in the sand\\
And I pulled away from land,\\
As I sailed\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
\vspace*{1em}
I murdered William Moore\\
And I left him in his gore\\
Twenty leagues away from shore\\
As I sailed,\\
And being crueler still, the gunner I did kill\\
All his precious blood did spill,\\
As I sailed,\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
\vspace*{1em}
I was sick and nigh to death,\\
And I vowed at every breath,\\
Oh to walk in wisdom's path,\\
As I sailed\\
But my repentance lasted not,\\
My vows I soon forgot,\\
Oh damnation is my lot,\\
As I sailed.\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
\vspace*{1em}
To the execution dock\\
Lay my head upon the block,\\
Laws no more I'll mock as I sail,\\
So take warning here and heed\\
To shun bad company\\
Or you'll wind up just like me\\
As I sailed.\\

\subsection{Captain Morgan}
\label{sec:orgd674dca}
\begin{verbatim}
Title: Captain Morgan
Artist: Jolly Rogers
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verse}
Eight months out, nothing to show\\
The crew's morale at an all time low\\
When we pulled in to Port Royal for repairs\\
The Captain went ashore for news\\
While we mended sails with the other crews\\
And talked about our sad state of affairs\\
\vspace*{1em}
The captain, he came bounding back\\
He said ``Boys, there's no time to unpack\\
`cause we're about to join our pirate fleet''\\
This news should have been met with cheers\\
But the crew was plagued with doubt and fears\\
So the captain said without missing a beat:\\
\vspace*{1em}
``Don't avoid it, don't fear it\\
Embrace your pirate spirit\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight''\\
\vspace*{1em}
``For adventure and glory\\
And an unforgettable story\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!''\\
\vspace*{1em}
``For Maracaibo we'll set sail\\
And there is no way we can fail\\
We'll have us a Navy of our own''\\
\vspace*{1em}
Like Portobello long before\\
We will sneak ourselves ashore\\
And we'll be rich before we come back home``\\
\vspace*{1em}
This got some cheers but not a lot\\
They knew the Cartagena plot\\
And all the pirates there that met their end\\
\vspace*{1em}
''Yes`` he says ''there's risk involved\\
But every problem can be solved\\
And we'll end up with more cash than we can spend``\\
''Don't avoid it, don't fear it\\
Embrace your pirate spirit\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight``\\
\vspace*{1em}
''For adventure and glory\\
And an unforgettable story\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!``\\
\vspace*{1em}
At last the crew they all agreed\\
As fear cannot win over greed\\
And we got our ship all ready and primed\\
\vspace*{1em}
We set the sails and sharpened swords\\
We pulled the anchor and wound the cords\\
There was no way that we would lose this time\\
\vspace*{1em}
With that the whole crew was met\\
Pledges made, and routes were set\\
Henry Morgan said ''Let not a thing go wrong!``\\
\vspace*{1em}
And as the fleet was heading out\\
You could hear our whole crew shout\\
''Listen up ye scurvy dogs and sing along;\\
\vspace*{1em}
``Don't avoid it, don't fear it\\
Embrace your pirate spirit\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight''\\
``For adventure and glory\\
And an unforgettable story\\
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!''\\

Brothers of the mine rejoice!\\
(Swing, swing, swing with me!)\\
Raise your pick and raise your voice!\\

Down and down into the deep\\
Who knows what we'll find beneath?\\
Diamonds, rubies, gold, and more\\
Hidden in the mountain store\\

Born underground\\
Suckled from a teat of stone\\
Raised in the dark\\
The safety of our mountain home\\

The sunlight will not reach this low\\

Stumble home and fall asleep\\
Dreaming in our mountain keep\\

Grown inside a rocky womb\\

We can never dig too deep\\

'Twas how the captain speech began\\
Each voyage's first night\\
He smiled said ``It's tradition\\
But I asked that you refrain\\
From carving your name in the beam\\
Next to her lofty mane.''\\
\vspace*{1em}
The first night I was there\\
Her mates held me in the air\\
And let me carve my name with theirs\\
To show that I was there\\
From boy to man we grew up as\\
Across the waves we roamed\\
As she heard me sob likе sons who'd lost their childhood home\\
Eight bells rang out in Dovеr\\
Eight bells rang out in Wales\\
Eight bells rang out in Liverpool\\
And Down to Murphy's scales\\
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale\\
Eight bells rang out in Boston town\\
Eight bells rang out in Nassau\\
The night the Merry Widow went down\\
\vspace*{1em}
As a mere midshipman's mate\\
I'd stare up at that beam\\
And knew that every name I saw\\
Was shared between a dream\\
Some of them so faded just a memory and a scratch\\
But they grew much clearer with every new batch\\
She made sure we made it back\\
To the lands we longed\\
And with the tide we all returned to the vessel we call home\\
There were parts we could have salvaged but I think we all agreed\\
That she deserved the honor of a burial at sea\\
\vspace*{1em}
Eight bells rang out in Dover\\
Eight bells rang out in Wales\\
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool\\
And down to murphy's scales\\
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale\\
Eight bells rang out in Boston town\\
Eight bells rang out in Nassau\\
The night the Merry Widow went down\\
By the time I was the bos'n, the list was 3 yards long\\
Though she had seen so many years, she still stood tall and strong\\
But the name she took her spirit\\
Bold and strong and true\\
And she raced the wind and never failed her brave and loyal crew\\
\vspace*{1em}
The ship she never floundered\\
Her defenses never breached\\
No matter her port of call her goal was always reached\\
When we were told her day had come and she had sailed her last\\
That they were tear her down for scrap\\
We couldn't let that pass\\
\vspace*{1em}
Eight bells rang out in Dover\\
Eight bells rang out in Wales\\
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool\\
And down to murphy's scales\\
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale\\
Eight bells rang out in Boston town\\
Eight bells rang out in Nassau\\
The night the Merry Widow went down\\
\vspace*{1em}
Through our grief we'd swore an oath\\
That we'd carry out our plan\\
And damn the risk we would push on to the strength of our last man\\
And as we stared at all the names of those that came before\\
We cut the line and stole that ship and sailed her out once more\\
Beyond the reef we sailed her\\
And set our love alight\\
We jumped ship and watched her burn from the shore that night\\
As she sank beneath the waves, we knew one thing for sure\\
She made more of a mark on us\\
Than we ever did on her\\
Eight bells rang out in Dover\\
Eight bells rang out in Wales\\
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool\\
And down to murphy's scales\\
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale\\
Eight bells rang out in Boston town\\

Tim Finnegan lived in Walken' Street\\
A gentleman Irishman mighty odd;\\
He seen a brogue so soft and sweet\\
And to rise in the world he carried the hod\\
\vspace*{1em}
Tim had a sort of a tipplin' way\\
With a love of the liquor now he was born\\
To help him on with his work each day\\
Had a ``drop of the cray-chur'' every morn\\
\vspace*{1em}
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner\\
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;\\
Wasn't it the truth I told you?\\
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake!\\
One mornin' Tim felt rather full\\
His head felt heavy which made him shake;\\
Fell from a ladder and he burst his skull\\
So they carried him home his corpse to wake\\
\vspace*{1em}
Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet\\
Laid him out upon the bed;\\
A gallon of whiskey at his feet\\
A barrel of porter at his head\\
\vspace*{1em}
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner\\
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;\\
Wasn't it the truth I told you?\\
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake!\\
\vspace*{1em}
His friends assembled at the wake\\
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch\\
First they brung in tea and cake;\\
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch\\
\vspace*{1em}
Biddy O'Brien began to cry\\
``Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see?\\
Tim mavournin, why did you die?''\\
Arragh, shut your gob said Paddy McGhee!\\

Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner\\
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;\\
Wasn't it the truth I told you?\\

Patty O'Connor took up the job\\
``Ah Biddy,'' says she, ``You're wrong, I'm sure''\\
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob\\
Then left her sprawlin' on the floor\\
\vspace*{1em}
Then the war did soon enrage\\
Woman to woman and man to man\\
Shillelagh-law was all the rage\\
And a row and a ruction soon began\\
\vspace*{1em}
Mickey Maloney lowered his head\\
And a bottle of whiskey flew at him\\
Missed, and fallin' on the bed\\
The liquor scattered over Tim!\\
\vspace*{1em}
Tim revives! See how he rises!\\
Timothy risin' from the bed\\
Sayin', ``Whirl your liquor around like blazes\\
Thunderin' Jaysus! Do you thunk I'm dead?''\\

\begin{verbatim}
Title: Flyin' Dutchman
Artist: Jolly Rogers
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verse}
The sky was grey and cloudy\\
And the wind was from the west\\
When we spied a battered frigate\\
With her tattered sail full dressed\\
They signaled they had letters home\\
They asked if we could take\\
They dropped them in a barrel\\
They left bobbing in their wake\\
We reefed the sails and slowed the ship\\
To fish they barrel out\\
The old ship sailed to the distance\\
And we saw her come about\\
The captain watched through a spy-glass\\
And we heard him catch his breath\\
And we saw the storm a-brewing\\
Had become a wall of death\\
\vspace*{1em}
Turn this ship around me boys\\
Turn around and run!\\
That storm it wants a battle\\
And it's sure that were outgunned!\\
What of the ship that's out there\\
Do we leave her to the gale?\\
She's called the Flying Dutchman\\
And it's rage that fills her sails!\\
\vspace*{1em}
The thunder growled like demons\\
And the lightning stabbed the waves\\
And the Dutchman she leapt t'wards us\\
Riding fury from the graves\\
Our captain, he stayed at the wheel\\
The crew they manned the lines\\
And still that ship and storm\\
Were quickly closing in behind\\
Our ship we crest a giant wave\\
And crashed to the trough below\\
And the crew held on to what they could\\
They were damned if they let go\\
The rain and sea and storm winds\\
Crashed against our ship with wrath\\
And from the deck of that cursed ship\\
We could hear them laugh\\
\vspace*{1em}
Turn this ship around me boys!\\
Turn around and run!\\
That storm it wants a battle\\
And it's sure that we're outgunned!\\
That ghostly ship is hunting us\\
It's bringing on the gale!\\
She's called the Flying Dutchman\\
And it's rage that fills her sails!\\
\vspace*{1em}
That was when we sighted land\\
It became a race with time\\
We believed it Santa Marta\\
The Dutchman closing in behind\\
``Risk it all!'' the captain cried\\
``It's the only chance we got!''\\
Salvation if we make it\\
And our souls if we get caught\\
The storm was all around us\\
And the Dutchman cut our wind\\
The beast nearly capsized up\\
And we watched our strong mast bend\\
We were almost to the harbor\\
We could see the natural break\\
And each man willed her forward\\
For they knew what was at stake\\
\vspace*{1em}
Once we charged into that harbor\\
The Dutchman heaved away\\
And we heard their bitter screams\\
For the devil lost his prey\\
Once we made it safely\\
To the leeward of the bay\\
We cracked that barrel open\\
To see what those letters say\\
There must have been a hundred\\
And that's when we realized\\
These moldy parchments were addressed\\
To those who'd long since died\\
If you see a battered frigate\\
‘neath a grey and stormy sky\\
Give way and watch behind you\\
Or you'll hear your captain cry\\

\vspace*{1em}
For thirty odd years, I have lived with this curse\\
My vocabulary was stunted at birth\\
By a witch doctor from over the seas\\
Casting a strange voodoo magic on me\\
Now when I speak, it's rather absurd\\
An endless tirade of four letter words\\
I lash out in anger at all in my way\\
Shocking unspeakable things that I say\\

Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker\\
We're gonna punch you right in the balls\\
Fuck you with a fucking anchor\\

\vspace*{1em}
Long I have waited to have my revenge\\
To bring that witch doctor to his bitter end\\
So I have gathered a ship and a crew\\
We're sailing to find him, we know what to do\\
On a dark moonless night, when he least suspects\\
We'll creep up behind him, so hard to detect\\
We'll bring out our anchor by the light of the stars\\
And shove it inside of his big fuckin' arse\\
\vspace*{1em}
Fuck you, you're a fucking wanker\\
We're gonna punch you right in the balls\\
Fuck you with a fucking anchor\\

Fresh out of college, with grades straight from Hell\\
I browsed for a trade at which I could excel\\
An ad for a ship in need of some manning\\
Men, sails, and purpose, but lacking a captain\\
\vspace*{1em}
What luck, says I, to find such good fortune!\\
A few white lies later, I ran down the pier\\
Bought me a coat and a cutlass or two\\
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled at the crew:\\
\vspace*{1em}
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!\\
What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!\\
Turn hard to port! (That's not port) Now I've got it!\\
Trust me, I'm in control!\\

So pull up the charts and those weird gold machines\\
I see what it says but no clue what it means!\\
Just pull on some levers and yank on some chains\\
Feign a bad back till we've landed again\\

As a boy I led a sheltered life\\
The son of a farmer and his wife\\
I met a friend one day in town\\
Who offered to buy me a round\\
So we found a pub they call the Drum and Pipe\\
\vspace*{1em}
Barkeep, he asked what will it be\\
So I said I think I'll have a tea\\
My friend said that will never do\\
Told me that I should have a brew\\
You wouldn't believe the effect it's had on me\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into\\
I know just exactly what I should do\\
I say in a voice that all can hear\\
Sir I think that I will have a beer\\
Yes, sir I think that I will have a beer\\
\vspace*{1em}
Since then I have traveled far and wide\\
I have been all over the countryside\\
One day, while out, on a walk\\
I met a Scot who liked to talk\\
And he told me of a drink I've never tried\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into\\
I know just exactly what I should do\\
I say in a voice that all can hear\\
Sir I think I'll have a scotch and beer\\
Yes, sir I think I'll have a scotch and beer\\
\vspace*{1em}
Spent a Summer on a schooner out at sea\\
And one old sailor took a shine to me\\
He warned me of the awful food\\
But shared a drink he said was good\\
I'm gonna have to say that I agree\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into\\
I know just exactly what I should do\\
I say in a voice that all can hear\\
Sir I think I'll have rum, scotch, and beer\\
Yes, sir I think I'll have rum, scotch, and beer\\
\vspace*{1em}
So when I made it back home again\\
I met up with a dear, old friend\\
He took me with him too his pub\\
Which seemed to be a fancy pub\\
And taught me about the drink of gentlemen\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into\\
I know just exactly what I should do\\
I say in a voice that all can hear\\
Sir I'll have gin, rum, scotch, and beer\\
Yes, sir I'll have gin, rum, scotch, and beer\\
\vspace*{1em}
I then met a nice, Irish lad\\
Who said that he thought it was sad\\
While I've tried all the rest\\
He said that I had missed the best\\
And he offered me the last of what he had\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into\\
I know just exactly what I should do\\

But the Straw Hat crew is the greatest team of G.O.A.T.'s\\
So when you face us you ain't leaving here afloat\\
Look at us, run seas\\
All about the money give us One Piece\\
Any thought that your crew was just all that\\
Then you learned a lesson stepping up to the Straw Hat\\
Got more flow than the navy\\
Making them sick now i'm feeling real wavy\\
Others are wasting their time\\
I’ll get the riches that’s on the grand line\\
Never back down\\
All of these villains that bug me are clowns\\
They underestimate but when i go to gear forth\\
Not a single one lasting a round\\
Don't come around, ain’t no one stopping our quest\\
Not even when there's a hole in my chest\\

You will not get the bounty that’s dead or alive\\

I'm a jet engine when i'm behind you\\
My muscles have been fine tuned breaking bones in your spine too\\
I'll find you like Foxy when you rap going too slow\\
Pop a pistol in your back like you're Blueno\\
Big mom on attack full of glucose\\
Too slow, bury Katakuri that's a tombstone\\
Oh, got a bounty in the billions\\
Oh, but it should be in the trillions\\
Oh, to me y'all look like civilians\\
Oh, Yonkos, Marines, i be killing em\\
Training with the dark king\\
Capable of more than talking\\
I'm saving Nami or Robin\\
Or my brother from his past hell\\
Enel, i'm simply shocking\\
My Haki will leave em dropping\\
This pirate will not be stopping\\
Til i reach the end at Raftel\\
Pumping the gear and i'm reaching the fourth\\
Chaos appears when i knock down your doors\\
Fill em with tears then i'm coming to war\\
Blood will be smeared when your decked on the floor\\
Bet you want more? Punches be faster than Kizuru, rage in my eyes when i'm on beat\\
Strength to my core, fighting until i get rid of you, limits the sky and the One Piece\\
Chorus (GameboyJones):\\
I don't know why you all think that you should doubt me\\
I'm a pirate and i say that very proudly\\
When i pull up with my team we stay rowdy\\
Count it up we're just racking up our bounty\\
King of the pirates, that'll be me\\
I will be captain of the seas\\
King of the pirates, that'll be me\\
I will be captain of the seas\\

You'll soon be dead from fright\\
So sailors tell their children\\
On a dark and stormy night\\

At forty fathoms deep\\

Nor east we sail to Brimstone head\\
The captain, crew, and I\\
At sixteen knots we fairly flew\\
Beneath a darkening sky\\

Atop the main mast I rode\\
Near ten stories high\\
Went up there blew an icy squall\\
And overboard went I\\

Raise up my head and kick my feet\\

Upon one summer's morning\\
I carefully did stray\\
Down by the Walls of Wapping\\
Where I met a sailor gay\\

Conversing with a young lass\\
Who seem'd to be in pain\\
Saying, William, when you go\\
I fear you'll ne'er return again\\

My heart is pierced by Cupid\\
I disdain all glittering gold\\
There is nothing can console me\\
But my jolly sailor bold\\

His hair it hangs in ringlets\\
His eyes as black as coal\\
My happiness attend him\\
Wherever he may go\\
\vspace*{1em}
From Tower Hill to Blackwall\\
I'll wander, weep and moan\\
All for my jolly sailor\\
Until he sails home\\

My heart is pierced by Cupid\\
I disdain all glittering gold\\
There is nothing can console me\\
But my jolly sailor bold\\

My father is a merchant\\
The truth I now will tell\\
And in great London City\\
In opulence doth dwell\\
\vspace*{1em}
His fortune doth exceed\\
300,000 gold\\
And he frowns upon his daughter\\
Who loves a sailor bold\\

True love has grafted my heart\\
Give me my sailor bold\\

Should he return in pov'rty\\
From o'er the ocean far\\
To my tender bosom\\
I'll press my jolly tar\\
\vspace*{1em}
My sailor is as smiling\\
As the pleasant month of May\\
And often we have wandered\\
Through Ratcliffe Highway\\
\vspace*{1em}
Many a pretty blooming\\
Young girl we did behold\\
Reclining on the bosom\\
Of her jolly sailor bold\\

A merchant's daughter fair\\
And I have left my parents\\
And three thousand pounds a year\\

Come all you pretty fair maids\\
Whoever you may be\\
Who love a jolly sailor\\
That plows the raging sea\\

While up aloft in storm\\
From me his absence mourn\\
And firmly pray arrive the day\\
He's never more to roam\\

We are the pirates who don't do anything\\

And if you ask us to do anything\\
We'll just tell you we don't do anything\\

Well, I've never been to Greenland\\

Up against the wall\\
And I've never kissed a chipmunk\\
And I've never gotten head lice\\
And I've never been to Boston in the fall\\

Huh? What are you talking about? What does a rooster or mashed potatoes have to do with being a pirate?\\

And who's ever kissed a chipmunk? That's just nonsense, why even bring it up? Am I right? What do you think?\\

Huh? No I don't\\

Do not\\

Plated in solid gold!\\
'Cause being teased about my little deck\\

Let's see, uh\\
I'd get rid of all the water\\
From down in the ballast hole (but we'll tip over!)\\
And replace it with some good dark rum\\
Where it can stay nice and cold!\\
Every man aboard the ship can drink\\
Until he's had his fill\\
And the only rude we'd enforce\\
Is that noone's allowed to spill!\\
(How about that? Take that, you'd have to replace it later)\\

I'd strip her down just to a rudder\\
A mast and a wheel (minimalism!)\\
I'd make her long and hard - and hollow\\
And cover her in steel! (urr!)\\
She'd be a giant floating cannon\\
No need for cabins and walls! (we-we need them)\\

Lucky Annie was a lady who'd been pleased by many men\\

Why the boys would look at her, it puzzled poor Flint Locke\\
She would sit and smile and nod and let them brag and talk\\
But if they tried to touch her well she'd put them on the run\\
Cause why would I need a lover when I've got myself a gun\\

So next time you're with a lady and she takes you to her bed\\
Be sure to please her well, and remember what we've said\\
For if you do not treat her right then know that this is true\\
Us ladies all can have our fun without involving you\\

\begin{verse}
No future was there in London for a poor man's son like me\\
So I left my home and I went to seek my fortune on the sea\\
I signed aboard a merchant ship bound for the west indies\\
And six weeks out we tapped into the winds of piracy\\
\vspace*{1em}
There we sails on the horizon and we tried to make a run\\
And when we saw that black flag then our running it was done\\
And when those pirates boarded us they told us one by one\\
``You can die or join our crew me boys\\
Time flies whеn you're having rum!''\\
Time flies whеn you're having rum me boys\\
Time flies when you're having rum\\
When you're sailing under the black flag\\
And you're firing all your guns\\
When you take a spanish treasure ship\\
You divide by the rule of thumb\\
Our voyage will be over soon enough\\
Time flies when you're having rum\\
\vspace*{1em}
With a pistol to my forehead\\
Then my choice was all too clear\\
I took leave of that merchant ship and became a buccaneer\\
And though they spared my life I think that if the truth be told\\
I joined them for the promise of\\
Adventure, rum and gold\\
\vspace*{1em}
The quartermaster handed me a cutlass and a gun\\
And as I signed their articles the captain told me ``Son\\
Us gentlemen of fortune live life fast and on the run\\
So step right up and take your share\\
Time flies when you're having rum!''\\
\vspace*{1em}
Time flies when you're having rum me boys\\
Time flies when you're having rum\\
When you're sailing under the black flag\\
And you're firing all your guns\\

Our voyage will be over soon enough\\
Time flies when you're having rum\\
For two long years I sailed with them\\
Around the Spanish Main\\
And capture ships from Portugal\\
From England, France and Spain\\
We took what we could and we gave none back\\
For that's the pirate's code\\
And in our wake the Caribbean Sea ran red with blood\\
\vspace*{1em}
The admiralty in London sent a fleet to hunt us down\\
A traitor in Port Royal told them where we could be found\\
They surrounded us in Nassau, the captain shouted\\
``Let `em come! The fight will be over soon enough\\
Time flies when you're having rum.''\\

\vspace*{1em}
We ran the red flag up and then we readied all our guns\\
No quarter would we give and in turn expected none\\
We got off one good broadside\\
But outnumbered ten to one\\
They took out half our crew\\
And then our pirating was done\\
They took us back to London Town nder key and lock\\
The hangman's noose was swinging at the execution dock\\
The captain turned and said to me, ``We had fine sailing son\\
The voyage it was over all too soon\\
Time flies when you're having rum.''\\

\vspace*{1em}
Now as you've listened to this tale by know\\
I'm sure you have surmised\\
That I slipped the hangman's cable\\
And escaped him with my life\\
But how I got away\\

My voyages they aren’t over yet\\

Stranded on Hispaniola, right there on the western tip\\
When the crew next saw him they could not believe their eyes\\
There was little left of the young man that one could recognize\\
His hair was long a braided, and he looked ready for war\\
But he smiled and said `` Hello mates. I'm your new bokor\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
When he starts his chanting we don't always understand\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
The captain said ''Now listen boys, I think we should turn back\\
There's a storm a brewing and that beast is building fast.``\\
The bokur said ''Just wait a minute and Captain keep your course``\\
And he went back to his cabin but the storm it just got worse\\
\vspace*{1em}
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash\\
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash\\
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door\\
And when we started to relax, it started up once more\\
\vspace*{1em}
He rushed out and said ''We'll need every inch of sail.``\\
And a swath of clear blue sky split the monstrous gale\\
The wind filed every sail and tightened every line\\
As we passed we saw the storm crashed back in behind\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
When he starts his chanting we don't always understand\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
\vspace*{1em}
While hunting down a merchant ship around the rocky shore\\
We came around the island to a massive Man o' War\\
The captain said '' Now listen boys. We're about to meet our doom.``\\
And the bokor shouted ''Never fear``\\
And he ran down to his room\\
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash\\
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash\\
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door\\
And when we started to relax, it started up once more\\
\vspace*{1em}
''Fire two shots!`` he shouted and they went off right on cue\\
Both shots found their target and their powder hold it blew\\
The Man o' War bust into flames and it began to pitch\\
And we stole enough from her to make sure we were rich\\
\vspace*{1em}
He still wears more tattoos than clothes\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
When he starts his chanting we don't try to understand\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
We always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
We always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\

\begin{verse}
[Verse 1]\\
There once was a ship that put to sea\\
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea\\
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down\\
O blow, my bully boys, blow (Huh!)\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go\\
[Verse 2]\\
She had not been two weeks from shore\\
When down on her, a right whale bore\\
The captain called all hands and swore\\
He'd take that whale in tow (Huh!)\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tеa and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is donе\\
We'll take our leave and go\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 3]\\
Before the boat had hit the water\\
The whale's tail came up and caught her\\
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her\\
When she dived down low (Huh!)\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 4]\\
No line was cut, no whale was freed\\
The Captain's mind was not of greed\\
But he belonged to the Wellerman's creed\\
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)\\
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 5]\\
For forty days, or even more\\
The line went slack, then tight once more\\
All boats were lost, there were only four\\
But still that whale did go (Huh!)\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 6]\\
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on\\
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone\\
The Wellerman makes his regular call\\
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all (Huh!)\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go (Huh!)\\
Soon may the Wellerman come\\
To bring us sugar and tea and rum\\
One day, when the tonguin' is done\\
We'll take our leave and go\\

Tuning: EADGBE\\
\vspace*{1em}
Hello. This is my first TAB so any additions, corrections and comments would be\\
appreciated. First off you should have a CAPO on the third fret. Afterwards just\\
use the chord patterns for the chords listed. The rhythm pattern for playing the\\
chords can easily be discerned by listening to the CD. As you’ll see the song is\\
rather simple, but it’s a superb song for parties or by the campfire, and is easily\\
memorized (the chords anyway). Plus it’s just a great song. What I have sounded okay\\
by my ear when I played it with the studio CD, but as I said any corrections/improvement\\
would be appreciated. Enjoy.\\

My father taught me well to shun the gates of hell\\

But against him I rebelled as I sailed\\
\hspace*{12em}D      Dsus4  D                       A\\
He shoved a Bible in my hand but I left it in the sand\\

And I pulled away from land as I sailed\\
\vspace*{1em}
Chorus\\
\vspace*{1em}
I murdered William Moore and I left him in his gore\\
Twenty leagues away from shore as I sailed,\\
And being crueler still, the gunner I did kill\\
All his precious blood did spill as I sailed,\\
\vspace*{1em}
Chorus\\
(After Chorus comes the nice snare drum solo, which uses the same chords as the Chorus)\\
\vspace*{1em}
I was sick and nigh to death and I vowed at every breath,\\
Oh to walk in wisdom's path as I sailed\\
But my repentance lasted not my vows I soon forgot\\
Oh damnation is my lot as I sailed\\
\vspace*{1em}
Chorus\\
\vspace*{1em}
To the execution dock lay my head upon the block\\
Laws no more I'll mock as I sail\\
So take warning here and heed to shun bad company\\
Or you'll wind up just like me as I sailed.\\

As a mere mid-shipmans mate\\

I'd stare up at that beam\\

And knew that every name I saw\\
\hspace*{7em}G               A\\
Would share with me a dream\\
\hspace*{1em}G                              A\\
Some of them so faded, just a memory and a scratch\\
\hspace*{5em}Bm              A           G\\
But they grew much clearer with every new batch\\

There were parts we could have salvaged but I think we all agreed\\

That she deserved the honor of a burial at sea\\

From her name she took her spirit\\

Bold and strong and true\\

We cut the line and stole that ship and sailed her out once more\\

As she sank beneath the waves, we knew one thing for sure\\

Dm\\
The sky was grey and cloudy and the wind was from the west\\
When we spied a battered frigate with her tattered sail full dressed\\
Gm\\
They signaled they had letters home they asked if we could take\\
Dm\\
They dropped 'em in a barrel they left bobbing in their wake\\
\vspace*{1em}
Dm\\
We reefed the sails and slowed the ship to fish the barrel out\\
The old ship sailed to the distance and we saw her come about\\
Gm\\
The captain watched through a spyglass and we heard him catch his breath\\
Dm\\
And we saw the storm a-brewing had become a wall of death\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
A                              G\\
Turn this ship around me boys, turn around and run\\

This storm it wants a battle and it's sure that we're outgunned\\
Dm                       F               G                A\\
What of the ship that's out there do we leave her to the gale?\\
N.C.\\
She's called the Flying Dutchman and it's wraiths that fills her sails.\\

Dm\\
The thunder growled like demons and the lightening stabbed the waves\\
And the Dutchman she lept towards us riding fury from the graves\\
Gm\\
Our captain he stayed at the wheel, the crew the manned the lines,\\
Dm\\
And still that ship and storm were quickly closing in behind.\\
\vspace*{1em}
Dm\\
Our ship we crest a giant wave and crash to the trough below\\
The crew held on to what they could, they were damned if they let go.\\
Gm\\
The rain and sea and storm winds crashed against our ship with wrath\\
Dm\\
And from the deck of that cursed ship, we could hear them laugh\\

This storm it wants a battle and it's sure that we're outgunned\\
Dm                    F                G               A\\
That ghostly ship is hunting us, it's bringing on the gale,\\
N.C.\\
She's called the Flying Dutchman and it's wraiths that fills her sails\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse]\\
Dm\\
That was when we sighted land, it became a race wih time\\
We believed it Santa Marta, the Dutchman closing in behind\\
Gm\\
``Risk it all'' the captain cried ``it's the only chance we've got,\\
Dm\\
Salvation if we make it and our souls if we get caught.''\\
\vspace*{1em}
Dm\\
The storm was all around us and the Dutchman cut our winds,\\
The beast nearly capsized us, and we watched our strong mast bend\\
Gm\\
We were almost to the harbour, we could see the natural break,\\
Dm\\
And each man willed her forward, for they knew what was at stake\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
A                              G\\
Turn this ship around me boys, turn around and run\\

This storm it wants a battle and it's sure that we're outgunned\\
Dm                    F                G               A\\
That ghostly ship is hunting us, it's bringing on the gale,\\
N.C.\\
She's called the Flying Dutchman and it's wraiths that fills her sails\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse]\\
Dm\\
Once we charged into that harbour, the Dutchman heaved away\\
And we heard their bitter screams, for the Devil lost his prey.\\
Gm\\
Once we made it safely to the leeward of the bay,\\
Dm\\
We cracked that barrel open to see what those letters say.\\
\vspace*{1em}
Dm\\
There must've been a hundred and that's when we realized,\\
Those moldy parchments were addressed to those who'd long since died.\\
Gm\\
If you see a battered frigate 'neath a grey and stormy sky,\\
Dm\\
Give way and watch mehind you, or you'll hear your captain cry:\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
A                              G\\
Turn this ship around me boys, turn around and run\\

This storm it wants a battle and it's sure that we're outgunned\\
Dm                    F                G               A\\

\begin{verse}
[Verse 1]\\
D                           G                   D\\
Fresh out of college, with grades straight from Hell\\
\hspace*{2em}D                            A\\
I browsed for a trade at which I could excel\\
D\\
An ad for a ship in need of some manning\\
D                            A         D\\
Men, sails, and purpose, but lacking a captain\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 2]\\
G                     D\\
What luck, says I, to find such good fortune!\\
\hspace*{2em}A                       D\\
A few white lies later, I ran down the pier\\
G                      D\\
Bought me a coat and a cutlass or two\\
A\\
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled at the crew:\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
G                   D\\
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!\\
A                           D\\
What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!\\
G                                    D\\
Turn hard to port! (That's not port) Now I've got it!\\
A                    D\\
Trust me, I'm in control!\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 3]\\
\hspace*{2em}D                           G         D\\
I can't sing the shanties, it has to be said\\
\hspace*{4em}D                          A\\
And all of that grog just goes right to my head\\
D                       G               D\\
Whale meat is gross and I miss a girl's laugh\\
D                       A\\
Five weeks at sea, even Dave seems a catch!\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
G                   D\\
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!\\
\hspace*{1em}A                              D\\
What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!\\
G                                    D\\
Turn hard to port! (That's not port) Now I've got it!\\
A                    D\\
Trust me, I'm in control!\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 4]\\
D                        G          D\\
We've hit icy waters, no land to be seen\\
D                              A\\
The food's getting low and the beer has gone green\\
\hspace*{8em}Bb                    Gm\\
There's murmurs of discontent under the deck\\
\hspace*{4em}F                    A\\
If I don't act fast, it could be my neck!\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 5]\\
\hspace*{3em}D                            G             D\\
So pull up the charts and those weird gold machines\\
\hspace*{2em}D                       A\\
I see what it says but no clue what it means!\\
\hspace*{5em}D                       G            D\\
Just pull on some levers and yank on some chains\\
D                           A\\
Feign a bad back 'til we've landed again\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
G                   D\\
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!\\

What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!\\

Trust me, I'm in control!\\

What's that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!\\

[Verse]\\
Am\\
He was a nice young sailor lad, as green as green could be\\
\hspace*{8em}C                           Am\\
When he first joined our crew for a life of piracy\\
\hspace*{7em}F                                Am\\
When a storm nearly capsized us, he was thrown from the ship\\
E\\
Stranded on Hispaniola, right there on the western tip\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 2]\\
Am\\
When the crew next saw him they could not believe their eyes\\
\hspace*{10em}C                                 Am\\
There was little left of the young man that one could recognize\\
\hspace*{4em}F                               Am\\
His hair was long a braided, and he looked ready for war\\
\hspace*{7em}E\\
But he smiled and said `` Hello mates. I'm your new Bokor ''\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
F                              Am\\
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes\\
\hspace*{7em}F                        Am          E\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
E                                    G\\
When he starts his chanting we don't always understand\\
\hspace*{7em}F             E             Am\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 3]\\
Am\\
The captain said ``Now listen boys, I think we should turn back\\
C                                  Am\\
There's a storm a brewing and that beast is building fast.''\\
\hspace*{4em}F                                  Am\\
The bokur said ``Just wait a minute and Captain keep your course''\\
\hspace*{7em}E\\
And he went back to his cabin but the storm it just got worse\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Bridge]\\
F                   G            Am\\
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash\\
F                  G     Am\\
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash\\
G                                       F\\
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door\\
\hspace*{4em}E                                           Am\\
And when we started to relax, it started up once more\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 4]\\
Am\\
He rushed out and said ``We'll need every inch of sail.''\\
C                             Am\\
And a swath of clear blue sky split the monstrous gale\\
\hspace*{4em}F                         Am\\
The wind filed every sail and tightened every line\\
E\\
As we passed we saw the storm crashed back in behind\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
F                              Am\\
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes\\
\hspace*{7em}F                        Am          E\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
E                                    G\\
When he starts his chanting we don't always understand\\
\hspace*{7em}F             E             Am\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 5]\\
Am\\
While hunting down a merchant ship around the rocky shore\\
\hspace*{3em}C                           Am\\
We came around the island to a massive Man o' War\\
\hspace*{4em}F                                       Am\\
The captain said `` Now listen boys. We're about to meet our doom.''\\
\hspace*{8em}E\\
And the bokur shouted ``Never fear''\\
E\\
And he ran down to his room\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Bridge]\\
F                   G            Am\\
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash\\
F                  G     Am\\
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash\\
G                                       F\\
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door\\
\hspace*{4em}E                                           Am\\
And when we started to relax, it started up once more\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Verse 6]\\
Am\\
``FIRE TWO SHOTS'' he shouted and they went off right on cue\\
C                                       Am\\
Both shots found their target and their powder hold it blew\\
\hspace*{4em}F                               Am\\
The Man o' War bust into flames and it began to pitch\\
E\\
And we stole enough from her to make sure we were rich\\
\vspace*{1em}
[Chorus]\\
F                                Am\\
He still wears more tattoos than clothes\\
\hspace*{7em}F                        Am           E\\
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose\\
E                                    G\\
When he starts his chanting we don't try to understand\\
\hspace*{7em}F             E             Am\\
But we always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
\hspace*{3em}F             E             Am\\
We always listen to him, cause he's our voodoo man\\
