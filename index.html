Whiskey, whiskey<br />
The singer’s getting sore<br />
We raised the roof<br />
Now we’re lowering the floor<br />
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more<br />
When I say 1,2 you say 3,4<br />
1,2,3,4<br />
<br />
Altogether<br />
Altogether gone<br />
It’s now or never if you want another song<br />
On and on goes the ringing of the bell<br />
Off we go, this song won’t sing itself<br />
So soldiers at my side<br />
It’s you and me tonight<br />
Whiskey, whiskey<br />
The singer’s getting sore<br />
We raised the roof<br />
Now we’re lowering the floor<br />
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more<br />

1,2,3,4<br />
<br />
Mister moonlight<br />
You gotta let ‘em play<br />
If the devils wanna dance<br />
Then the piper wants his pay<br />
Hide me in a hiding place<br />
Where good sense never goes<br />
Take me to the fountain<br />
Where the firewater flows<br />
Find our alibies and lies<br />
And lose ourselves tonight<br />
<br />
Whiskey, whiskey<br />
The singer’s getting sore<br />
We raised the roof<br />
Now we’re lowering the floor<br />
The band is blistered but we’ve got a little bit more<br />
When I say 1,2 you say 3,4<br />
1,2,3,4<br />
Trying to get the whole room on the dance floor<br />
Is like trying to put a square peg in a round hole<br />
I’m not saying it ain’t something that we shouldn’t try to do<br />
Don’t do it for me though, do it for you<br />
You’ve been minding your manners and behaving yourself<br />
But there’s still a lot of bottles left upon the shelf<br />
So wet my little whistle now and give a dog a bone<br />
I can take it up a notch, can’t do it alone<br />
So soldiers at my side<br />
It’s you and me tonight<br />
<br />
Whiskey, whiskey<br />

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p class="verse">
[Verse 1]<br />
Oh, the year was 1778<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
A letter of marque came from the king<br />
To the scummiest vessel I&rsquo;ve ever seen<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
For twenty brave men all fishermen who<br />
Would make for him the Antelope&rsquo;s crew<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
She&rsquo;d a list to the port and her sails in rags<br />
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
<br />
[Verse 4]<br />
On the King&rsquo;s birthday we put to sea<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
We were 91 days to Montego Bay<br />
Pumping like madmen all the way<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
[Verse 5]<br />
On the 96th day we sailed again<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight<br />
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
<br />
[Verse 6]<br />
Now the Yankee lay low down with gold<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays<br />
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
<br />
[Verse 7]<br />
Then at length we stood two cables away<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din<br />
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
[Verse 8]<br />
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs<br />
And the Main truck carried off both me legs<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />
<br />
[Verse 9]<br />
So here I lay in my 23rd year<br />
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now<br />
It&rsquo;s been 6 years since we sailed away<br />
And I just made Halifax yesterday<br />
God damn them all! I was told<br />
We&rsquo;d cruise the seas for American gold<br />
We&rsquo;d fire no guns, shed no tears<br />
But I&rsquo;m a broken man on a Halifax pier<br />
The last of Barrett&rsquo;s Privateers<br />

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p class="verse">
Out on the endless ocean<br />
We tear along the gales<br />
With rum inside our bellies warm<br />
And freedom in our sails<br />
<br />
A wayward bunch of scoundrels<br />
Assassins, thieves and slaves<br />
The rich and blue-bloods fear us when<br />
We hunt upon the waves<br />
<br />
And when you see it coming<br />
That flag of baleful black<br />
No point in turning tail there&rsquo;s no<br />
Escaping our attack!<br />
YO-HO!<br />
YO-HO!<br />
We row beneath the black flag<br />
A rollickin&rsquo; we go!<br />
We own the sea and sky<br />
YO-HO!<br />
YO-HO!<br />
We row beneath the black flag<br />
A rollickin&rsquo; we go!<br />
We bleed the kingdoms dry!<br />
<br />
Defy the odds against us<br />
A pirate knows no fear<br />
Our steel is ready and our<br />
Retribution is severe<br />
<br />
We plunder from the greedy<br />
With blood and with our steel<br />
We rob the rich of their<br />
Ill-gotten gain and make them kneel<br />
<br />
Behold the ocean&rsquo;s mysteries<br />
The tales of ancient deeds<br />
We follow in the footsteps<br />
Of a silent secret creed<br />
Come on, lads!<br />
<br />
YO-HO!<br />
YO-HO!<br />
We row beneath the black flag<br />
A rollickin&rsquo; we go!<br />
We own the sea and sky<br />
YO-HO!<br />
YO-HO!<br />

Sea wind blows. To where?<br />
Who knows?<br />
The waves will be our guide!<br />
O&rsquo;er across the ocean&rsquo;s tide,<br />
Rays of sunshine far and wide,<br />
Birds they sing of cheerful things, in circles passing by!<br />
Bid farewell to weaver&rsquo;s town!<br />
Say so long to port renowned!<br />
Sing a song, it won&rsquo;t be long, before we&rsquo;re casting off!<br />
Cross the gold and silver seas<br />
The salty spray puts us at ease!<br />
Day and night to our delight,<br />
The voyage never ends!<br />
Gather up all of the crew!<br />
It&rsquo;s time to ship out Bink&rsquo;s brew!<br />
Pirates we, eternally are challenging the sea!<br />
With the waves to rest our heads,<br />
ship beneath us as our beds!<br />
Hoisted high upon the mast our Jolly Roger flies!<br />
Somewhere in the endless sky,<br />
Stormy winds are blowin&rsquo; by!<br />
Waves are dancing, evening comes,<br />
It&rsquo;s time to sound the drums!<br />
But steady men may never fear!<br />
Tomorrow&rsquo;s skies are always clear!<br />
So pound your feet and clap your hands till sunny days return!<br />

Our memories remain.<br />
Our days are but a passing dream, everlasting though they seem<br />
&rsquo;neath the moon we&rsquo;ll meet again, the wind&rsquo;s our lullaby!<br />
Gather up all of the crew!<br />
It&rsquo;s time to ship out Bink&rsquo;s brew!<br />
Sing a song and play along<br />
For all the ocean&rsquo;s wide!<br />
After all is said and done,<br />

So spread your tale, from dawn till dusk, upon these foamy seas!<br />

My name is Captain Kidd<br />
As I sailed, as I sailed,<br />
Oh my name is Captain Kidd as I sailed,<br />
My name is Captain Kidd<br />
And God&rsquo;s laws I did forbid,<br />
And most wickedly I did as I sailed.<br />
<br />
My father taught me well<br />
To shun the gates of hell,<br />
But against him I rebelled as I sailed,<br />
He shoved a bible in my hand<br />
But I left it in the sand<br />
And I pulled away from land,<br />
As I sailed<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
I murdered William Moore<br />
And I left him in his gore<br />
Twenty leagues away from shore<br />
As I sailed,<br />
And being crueler still, the gunner I did kill<br />
All his precious blood did spill,<br />
As I sailed,<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
I was sick and nigh to death,<br />
And I vowed at every breath,<br />
Oh to walk in wisdom&rsquo;s path,<br />
As I sailed<br />
But my repentance lasted not,<br />
My vows I soon forgot,<br />
Oh damnation is my lot,<br />
As I sailed.<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
To the execution dock<br />
Lay my head upon the block,<br />
Laws no more I&rsquo;ll mock as I sail,<br />
So take warning here and heed<br />
To shun bad company<br />
Or you&rsquo;ll wind up just like me<br />
As I sailed.<br />

Title: Captain Morgan
Artist: Jolly Rogers
</pre>
<p class="verse">
Eight months out, nothing to show<br />
The crew&rsquo;s morale at an all time low<br />
When we pulled in to Port Royal for repairs<br />
The Captain went ashore for news<br />
While we mended sails with the other crews<br />
And talked about our sad state of affairs<br />
<br />
The captain, he came bounding back<br />
He said &ldquo;Boys, there&rsquo;s no time to unpack<br />
&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re about to join our pirate fleet&rdquo;<br />
This news should have been met with cheers<br />
But the crew was plagued with doubt and fears<br />
So the captain said without missing a beat:<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t avoid it, don&rsquo;t fear it<br />
Embrace your pirate spirit<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;For adventure and glory<br />
And an unforgettable story<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;For Maracaibo we&rsquo;ll set sail<br />
And there is no way we can fail<br />
We&rsquo;ll have us a Navy of our own&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Like Portobello long before<br />
We will sneak ourselves ashore<br />
And we&rsquo;ll be rich before we come back home&ldquo;<br />
<br />
This got some cheers but not a lot<br />
They knew the Cartagena plot<br />
And all the pirates there that met their end<br />
<br />
&rdquo;Yes&ldquo; he says &rdquo;there&rsquo;s risk involved<br />
But every problem can be solved<br />
And we&rsquo;ll end up with more cash than we can spend&ldquo;<br />
&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t avoid it, don&rsquo;t fear it<br />
Embrace your pirate spirit<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight&ldquo;<br />
<br />
&rdquo;For adventure and glory<br />
And an unforgettable story<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!&ldquo;<br />
<br />
At last the crew they all agreed<br />
As fear cannot win over greed<br />
And we got our ship all ready and primed<br />
<br />
We set the sails and sharpened swords<br />
We pulled the anchor and wound the cords<br />
There was no way that we would lose this time<br />
<br />
With that the whole crew was met<br />
Pledges made, and routes were set<br />
Henry Morgan said &rdquo;Let not a thing go wrong!&ldquo;<br />
<br />
And as the fleet was heading out<br />
You could hear our whole crew shout<br />
&rdquo;Listen up ye scurvy dogs and sing along;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t avoid it, don&rsquo;t fear it<br />
Embrace your pirate spirit<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;For adventure and glory<br />
And an unforgettable story<br />
We sail with Captain Morgan tonight!&rdquo;<br />

Brothers of the mine rejoice!<br />
(Swing, swing, swing with me!)<br />
Raise your pick and raise your voice!<br />
(Sing, sing, sing with me!)<br />
Down and down into the deep<br />
Who knows what we&rsquo;ll find beneath?<br />
Diamonds, rubies, gold, and more<br />
Hidden in the mountain store<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus 1]<br />
Born underground<br />
Suckled from a teat of stone<br />
Raised in the dark<br />
The safety of our mountain home<br />
Skin made of iron<br />
Steel in our bones<br />
To dig and dig makes us free<br />
Come on, brothers, sing with me!<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I am a dwarf and I&rsquo;m digging a hole<br />
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br />
I am a dwarf and I&rsquo;m digging a hole<br />
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br />

[Verse 2]<br />
The sunlight will not reach this low<br />
(Deep, deep in the mine)<br />
Never seen the blue moon glow<br />
(Dwarves won&rsquo;t fly so high)<br />
Fill a glass and down some mead<br />
Stuff your bellies at the feast!<br />
Stumble home and fall asleep<br />
Dreaming in our mountain keep<br />
<br />
[Pre-Chorus 2]<br />
Born underground<br />
Grown inside a rocky womb<br />
The Earth is our cradle<br />
The mountain shall become our tomb<br />
Face us on the battlefield<br />
You will meet your doom<br />
We do not fear what lies beneath<br />
We can never dig too deep<br />
[Chorus]<br />
I am a dwarf and I&rsquo;m digging a hole<br />
Diggy diggy hole, diggy diggy hole<br />
I am a dwarf and I&rsquo;m digging a hole<br />
Diggy diggy hole, digging a hole<br />

&ldquo;This will be our home me boys<br />
So I trust you&rsquo;ll treat her right.&rdquo;<br />
&rsquo;Twas how the captain speech began<br />
Each voyage&rsquo;s first night<br />
He smiled said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tradition<br />
But I asked that you refrain<br />
From carving your name in the beam<br />
Next to her lofty mane.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The first night I was there<br />
Her mates held me in the air<br />
And let me carve my name with theirs<br />
To show that I was there<br />
From boy to man we grew up as<br />
Across the waves we roamed<br />
As she heard me sob likе sons who&rsquo;d lost their childhood home<br />
Eight bells rang out in Dovеr<br />
Eight bells rang out in Wales<br />
Eight bells rang out in Liverpool<br />
And Down to Murphy&rsquo;s scales<br />
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale<br />
Eight bells rang out in Boston town<br />
Eight bells rang out in Nassau<br />
The night the Merry Widow went down<br />
<br />
As a mere midshipman&rsquo;s mate<br />
I&rsquo;d stare up at that beam<br />
And knew that every name I saw<br />
Was shared between a dream<br />
Some of them so faded just a memory and a scratch<br />
But they grew much clearer with every new batch<br />
She made sure we made it back<br />
To the lands we longed<br />
And with the tide we all returned to the vessel we call home<br />
There were parts we could have salvaged but I think we all agreed<br />
That she deserved the honor of a burial at sea<br />
<br />
Eight bells rang out in Dover<br />
Eight bells rang out in Wales<br />
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool<br />
And down to murphy&rsquo;s scales<br />
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale<br />
Eight bells rang out in Boston town<br />
Eight bells rang out in Nassau<br />
The night the Merry Widow went down<br />
By the time I was the bos&rsquo;n, the list was 3 yards long<br />
Though she had seen so many years, she still stood tall and strong<br />
But the name she took her spirit<br />
Bold and strong and true<br />
And she raced the wind and never failed her brave and loyal crew<br />
<br />
The ship she never floundered<br />
Her defenses never breached<br />
No matter her port of call her goal was always reached<br />
When we were told her day had come and she had sailed her last<br />
That they were tear her down for scrap<br />
We couldn&rsquo;t let that pass<br />
<br />
Eight bells rang out in Dover<br />
Eight bells rang out in Wales<br />
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool<br />
And down to murphy&rsquo;s scales<br />
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale<br />
Eight bells rang out in Boston town<br />
Eight bells rang out in Nassau<br />
The night the Merry Widow went down<br />
<br />
Through our grief we&rsquo;d swore an oath<br />
That we&rsquo;d carry out our plan<br />
And damn the risk we would push on to the strength of our last man<br />
And as we stared at all the names of those that came before<br />
We cut the line and stole that ship and sailed her out once more<br />
Beyond the reef we sailed her<br />
And set our love alight<br />
We jumped ship and watched her burn from the shore that night<br />
As she sank beneath the waves, we knew one thing for sure<br />
She made more of a mark on us<br />
Than we ever did on her<br />
Eight bells rang out in Dover<br />
Eight bells rang out in Wales<br />
Eight Bells rang out in Liverpool<br />
And down to murphy&rsquo;s scales<br />
Eight bells rang out in Port Royale<br />
Eight bells rang out in Boston town<br />
Eight bells rang out in Nassau<br />
The night the Merry Widow went down<br />
<br />
Eight bells rang out…<br />

We’ll rant and we’ll roar like true British sailors<br />
We’ll rant and we’ll rave across the salt seas<br />

Next Ram&rsquo;s Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight<br />

<br />
We’ll rant and we’ll roar like true British sailors<br />
We’ll rant and we’ll rave across the salt seas<br />
Until we strike soundings in the Channel of England<br />
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-four leagues<br />
<br />
Let every man here drink up his full bumper<br />
Let every man here drink up his full bowl<br />
And let us be jolly and drown melancholy<br />
Singing, here’s a good health to each true-hearted lass<br />
We’ll rant and we’ll roar like true British sailors<br />
We’ll rant and we’ll rave across the salt seas<br />
Until we strike soundings in the Channel of England<br />
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-four leagues<br />

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-15">
<p class="verse">
Tim Finnegan lived in Walken&rsquo; Street<br />
A gentleman Irishman mighty odd;<br />
He seen a brogue so soft and sweet<br />
And to rise in the world he carried the hod<br />
<br />
Tim had a sort of a tipplin&rsquo; way<br />
With a love of the liquor now he was born<br />
To help him on with his work each day<br />
Had a &ldquo;drop of the cray-chur&rdquo; every morn<br />
<br />
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner<br />
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t it the truth I told you?<br />
Lots of fun at Finnegan&rsquo;s wake!<br />
One mornin&rsquo; Tim felt rather full<br />
His head felt heavy which made him shake;<br />
Fell from a ladder and he burst his skull<br />
So they carried him home his corpse to wake<br />
<br />
Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet<br />
Laid him out upon the bed;<br />
A gallon of whiskey at his feet<br />
A barrel of porter at his head<br />
<br />
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner<br />
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t it the truth I told you?<br />
Lots of fun at Finnegan&rsquo;s wake!<br />
<br />
His friends assembled at the wake<br />
And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch<br />
First they brung in tea and cake;<br />
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch<br />
<br />
Biddy O&rsquo;Brien began to cry<br />
&ldquo;Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see?<br />
Tim mavournin, why did you die?&rdquo;<br />
Arragh, shut your gob said Paddy McGhee!<br />
<br />
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner<br />
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t it the truth I told you?<br />
Lots of fun at Finnegan&rsquo;s wake!<br />
Patty O&rsquo;Connor took up the job<br />
&ldquo;Ah Biddy,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, I&rsquo;m sure&rdquo;<br />
Biddy gave her a belt in the gob<br />
Then left her sprawlin&rsquo; on the floor<br />
<br />
Then the war did soon enrage<br />
Woman to woman and man to man<br />
Shillelagh-law was all the rage<br />
And a row and a ruction soon began<br />
<br />
Mickey Maloney lowered his head<br />
And a bottle of whiskey flew at him<br />
Missed, and fallin&rsquo; on the bed<br />
The liquor scattered over Tim!<br />
<br />
Tim revives! See how he rises!<br />
Timothy risin&rsquo; from the bed<br />
Sayin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Whirl your liquor around like blazes<br />
Thunderin&rsquo; Jaysus! Do you thunk I&rsquo;m dead?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Whack fol the da O, dance to your partner<br />
Welt the floor, your trotters shake;<br />
Wasn&rsquo;t it the truth I told you?<br />
Lots of fun at Finnegan&rsquo;s wake!<br />

<p class="verse">
The sky was grey and cloudy<br />
And the wind was from the west<br />
When we spied a battered frigate<br />
With her tattered sail full dressed<br />
They signaled they had letters home<br />
They asked if we could take<br />
They dropped them in a barrel<br />
They left bobbing in their wake<br />
We reefed the sails and slowed the ship<br />
To fish they barrel out<br />
The old ship sailed to the distance<br />
And we saw her come about<br />
The captain watched through a spy-glass<br />
And we heard him catch his breath<br />
And we saw the storm a-brewing<br />
Had become a wall of death<br />
<br />
Turn this ship around me boys<br />
Turn around and run!<br />
That storm it wants a battle<br />
And it&rsquo;s sure that were outgunned!<br />
What of the ship that&rsquo;s out there<br />
Do we leave her to the gale?<br />
She&rsquo;s called the Flying Dutchman<br />
And it&rsquo;s rage that fills her sails!<br />
<br />
The thunder growled like demons<br />
And the lightning stabbed the waves<br />
And the Dutchman she leapt t&rsquo;wards us<br />
Riding fury from the graves<br />
Our captain, he stayed at the wheel<br />
The crew they manned the lines<br />
And still that ship and storm<br />
Were quickly closing in behind<br />
Our ship we crest a giant wave<br />
And crashed to the trough below<br />
And the crew held on to what they could<br />
They were damned if they let go<br />
The rain and sea and storm winds<br />
Crashed against our ship with wrath<br />
And from the deck of that cursed ship<br />
We could hear them laugh<br />
<br />
Turn this ship around me boys!<br />
Turn around and run!<br />
That storm it wants a battle<br />
And it&rsquo;s sure that we&rsquo;re outgunned!<br />
That ghostly ship is hunting us<br />
It&rsquo;s bringing on the gale!<br />
She&rsquo;s called the Flying Dutchman<br />
And it&rsquo;s rage that fills her sails!<br />
<br />
That was when we sighted land<br />
It became a race with time<br />
We believed it Santa Marta<br />
The Dutchman closing in behind<br />
&ldquo;Risk it all!&rdquo; the captain cried<br />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only chance we got!&rdquo;<br />
Salvation if we make it<br />
And our souls if we get caught<br />
The storm was all around us<br />
And the Dutchman cut our wind<br />
The beast nearly capsized up<br />
And we watched our strong mast bend<br />
We were almost to the harbor<br />
We could see the natural break<br />
And each man willed her forward<br />
For they knew what was at stake<br />
<br />
Once we charged into that harbor<br />
The Dutchman heaved away<br />
And we heard their bitter screams<br />
For the devil lost his prey<br />
Once we made it safely<br />
To the leeward of the bay<br />
We cracked that barrel open<br />
To see what those letters say<br />
There must have been a hundred<br />
And that&rsquo;s when we realized<br />
These moldy parchments were addressed<br />
To those who&rsquo;d long since died<br />
If you see a battered frigate<br />
‘neath a grey and stormy sky<br />
Give way and watch behind you<br />
Or you&rsquo;ll hear your captain cry<br />

<p class="verse">
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
<br />
(Go!)<br />
<br />
For thirty odd years, I have lived with this curse<br />
My vocabulary was stunted at birth<br />
By a witch doctor from over the seas<br />
Casting a strange voodoo magic on me<br />
Now when I speak, it&rsquo;s rather absurd<br />
An endless tirade of four letter words<br />
I lash out in anger at all in my way<br />
Shocking unspeakable things that I say<br />
<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
<br />
(Fuck you!)<br />
<br />
Long I have waited to have my revenge<br />
To bring that witch doctor to his bitter end<br />
So I have gathered a ship and a crew<br />
We&rsquo;re sailing to find him, we know what to do<br />
On a dark moonless night, when he least suspects<br />
We&rsquo;ll creep up behind him, so hard to detect<br />
We&rsquo;ll bring out our anchor by the light of the stars<br />
And shove it inside of his big fuckin&rsquo; arse<br />
<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />
You&rsquo;re all cunts so fuck you all<br />
Fuck you, you&rsquo;re a fucking wanker<br />
We&rsquo;re gonna punch you right in the balls<br />
Fuck you with a fucking anchor<br />

Fresh out of college, with grades straight from Hell<br />
I browsed for a trade at which I could excel<br />
An ad for a ship in need of some manning<br />
Men, sails, and purpose, but lacking a captain<br />
<br />
What luck, says I, to find such good fortune!<br />
A few white lies later, I ran down the pier<br />
Bought me a coat and a cutlass or two<br />
Jumped on the deck, and I yelled at the crew:<br />
<br />
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!<br />
What&rsquo;s that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!<br />
Turn hard to port! (That&rsquo;s not port) Now I&rsquo;ve got it!<br />
Trust me, I&rsquo;m in control!<br />
<br />
I can&rsquo;t sing the shanties, it has to be said<br />
And all of that grog just goes right to my head<br />
Whale meat is gross and I miss a girl&rsquo;s laugh<br />
Five weeks at sea, even Dave seems a catch!<br />
<br />
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!<br />
What&rsquo;s that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!<br />
Turn hard to port! (That&rsquo;s not port) Now I&rsquo;ve got it!<br />
Trust me, I&rsquo;m in control!<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve hit icy waters, no land to be seen<br />
The food&rsquo;s getting low and the beer has gone green<br />
There&rsquo;s murmurs of discontent under the deck<br />
If I don&rsquo;t act fast, it could be my neck!<br />
<br />
So pull up the charts and those weird gold machines<br />
I see what it says but no clue what it means!<br />
Just pull on some levers and yank on some chains<br />
Feign a bad back till we&rsquo;ve landed again<br />
<br />
Hoist up the thing! Batten down the whatsit!<br />
What&rsquo;s that thing spinning? Somebody should stop it!<br />
Turn hard to port! (That&rsquo;s not port) Now I&rsquo;ve got it!<br />
Trust me, I&rsquo;m in control!<br />

Title: I'll Have A Beer
</pre>
<p class="verse">
As a boy I led a sheltered life<br />
The son of a farmer and his wife<br />
I met a friend one day in town<br />
Who offered to buy me a round<br />
So we found a pub they call the Drum and Pipe<br />
<br />
Barkeep, he asked what will it be<br />
So I said I think I&rsquo;ll have a tea<br />
My friend said that will never do<br />
Told me that I should have a brew<br />
You wouldn&rsquo;t believe the effect it&rsquo;s had on me<br />
<br />
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into<br />
I know just exactly what I should do<br />
I say in a voice that all can hear<br />
Sir I think that I will have a beer<br />
Yes, sir I think that I will have a beer<br />
<br />
Since then I have traveled far and wide<br />
I have been all over the countryside<br />
One day, while out, on a walk<br />
I met a Scot who liked to talk<br />
And he told me of a drink I&rsquo;ve never tried<br />
<br />
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into<br />
I know just exactly what I should do<br />
I say in a voice that all can hear<br />
Sir I think I&rsquo;ll have a scotch and beer<br />
Yes, sir I think I&rsquo;ll have a scotch and beer<br />
<br />
Spent a Summer on a schooner out at sea<br />
And one old sailor took a shine to me<br />
He warned me of the awful food<br />
But shared a drink he said was good<br />
I&rsquo;m gonna have to say that I agree<br />
<br />
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into<br />
I know just exactly what I should do<br />
I say in a voice that all can hear<br />
Sir I think I&rsquo;ll have rum, scotch, and beer<br />
Yes, sir I think I&rsquo;ll have rum, scotch, and beer<br />
<br />
So when I made it back home again<br />
I met up with a dear, old friend<br />
He took me with him too his pub<br />
Which seemed to be a fancy pub<br />
And taught me about the drink of gentlemen<br />
<br />
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into<br />
I know just exactly what I should do<br />
I say in a voice that all can hear<br />
Sir I&rsquo;ll have gin, rum, scotch, and beer<br />
Yes, sir I&rsquo;ll have gin, rum, scotch, and beer<br />
<br />
I then met a nice, Irish lad<br />
Who said that he thought it was sad<br />
While I&rsquo;ve tried all the rest<br />
He said that I had missed the best<br />
And he offered me the last of what he had<br />
<br />
Now at every tavern, bar, and pub I go into<br />
I know just exactly what I should do<br />
I say in a voice that all can hear<br />
I&rsquo;ll have whiskey, gin, rum, scotch, and beer<br />
Yes, I&rsquo;ll have whiskey, gin, rum, scotch, and beer<br />
I&rsquo;&rsquo;ll have whiskey, gin, rum, scotch and beer<br />
I&rsquo;ll have whiskey, gin, rum, scotch and beer<br />
<br />
Whiskey<br />
Gin, rum<br />
Scotch and<br />
A beer<br />

Chorus (GameboyJones):<br />
I don&rsquo;t know why you all think that you should doubt me<br />
I’m a pirate and i say that very proudly<br />
When i pull up with my team we stay rowdy<br />
Count it up we&rsquo;re just racking up our bounty<br />
King of the pirates, that&rsquo;ll be me<br />
I will be captain of the seas<br />
King of the pirates, that’ll be me<br />
I will be captain of the seas<br />
<br />
Verse 1 (GameboyJones):<br />
When i gum gum stretch with my gum gum neck<br />
I&rsquo;m just looking at the seas for these dumb scum pest<br />
When i gum gum flex then you know what&rsquo;s next<br />
Like a washed up ship you about to get wrecked<br />
With a gum gum punch when i pull up to your boat<br />
I don&rsquo;t need to brag i don&rsquo;t even to boast<br />
But the Straw Hat crew is the greatest team of G.O.A.T.&rsquo;s<br />
So when you face us you ain&rsquo;t leaving here afloat<br />
Look at us, run seas<br />
All about the money give us One Piece<br />
Any thought that your crew was just all that<br />
Then you learned a lesson stepping up to the Straw Hat<br />
Got more flow than the navy<br />
Making them sick now i&rsquo;m feeling real wavy<br />
Others are wasting their time<br />
I’ll get the riches that’s on the grand line<br />
Never back down<br />
All of these villains that bug me are clowns<br />
They underestimate but when i go to gear forth<br />
Not a single one lasting a round<br />
Don&rsquo;t come around, ain’t no one stopping our quest<br />
Not even when there&rsquo;s a hole in my chest<br />
I&rsquo;ve got a mission and won&rsquo;t be denied<br />
You will not get the bounty that’s dead or alive<br />
Chorus (GameboyJones):<br />
I don&rsquo;t know why you all think that you should doubt me<br />
I&rsquo;m a pirate and i say that very proudly<br />
When i pull up with my team we stay rowdy<br />

King of the pirates, that&rsquo;ll be me<br />
I will be captain of the seas<br />
King of the pirates, that&rsquo;ll be me<br />
I will be captain of the seas<br />
<br />
Verse 2 (Rustage):<br />
Uh, feeling all the pressure in my ligaments, i&rsquo;m willing to pummel up anybody who&rsquo;s hurting someone in my crew<br />
Remind you<br />
I&rsquo;m a jet engine when i&rsquo;m behind you<br />
My muscles have been fine tuned breaking bones in your spine too<br />
I&rsquo;ll find you like Foxy when you rap going too slow<br />
Pop a pistol in your back like you&rsquo;re Blueno<br />
Big mom on attack full of glucose<br />
Too slow, bury Katakuri that&rsquo;s a tombstone<br />
Oh, got a bounty in the billions<br />
Oh, but it should be in the trillions<br />
Oh, to me y&rsquo;all look like civilians<br />
Oh, Yonkos, Marines, i be killing em<br />
Training with the dark king<br />
Capable of more than talking<br />
I&rsquo;m saving Nami or Robin<br />
Or my brother from his past hell<br />
Enel, i&rsquo;m simply shocking<br />
My Haki will leave em dropping<br />
This pirate will not be stopping<br />
Til i reach the end at Raftel<br />
Pumping the gear and i&rsquo;m reaching the fourth<br />
Chaos appears when i knock down your doors<br />
Fill em with tears then i&rsquo;m coming to war<br />
Blood will be smeared when your decked on the floor<br />
Bet you want more? Punches be faster than Kizuru, rage in my eyes when i&rsquo;m on beat<br />
Strength to my core, fighting until i get rid of you, limits the sky and the One Piece<br />
Chorus (GameboyJones):<br />
I don&rsquo;t know why you all think that you should doubt me<br />
I&rsquo;m a pirate and i say that very proudly<br />

Tomorrow you will get your pay<br />

<p class="verse">
Some say he steers a spectral ship<br />
That&rsquo;s ghostly, grey, and grand<br />
He&rsquo;s doomed to sail the seven seas<br />
And ne&rsquo;er set foot on land<br />
<br />
And if you chance to see him<br />
You&rsquo;ll soon be dead from fright<br />
So sailors tell their children<br />
On a dark and stormy night<br />
<br />
Oh Forty fathoms deep he walks<br />
With rusty keys his locker locks<br />
Just like he&rsquo;s half asleep he stalks<br />
Forty fathoms deep<br />
Forty fathoms deep he owns<br />
Each sleeping sailor&rsquo;s soggy bones<br />
The legend they call Davy Jones<br />
At forty fathoms deep<br />
<br />
Nor east we sail to Brimstone head<br />
The captain, crew, and I<br />
At sixteen knots we fairly flew<br />
Beneath a darkening sky<br />
<br />
Atop the main mast I rode<br />
Near ten stories high<br />
Went up there blew an icy squall<br />
And overboard went I<br />
<br />
Oh Forty fathoms deep he walks<br />
With rusty keys his locker locks<br />
Just like he&rsquo;s half asleep he stalks<br />
Forty fathoms deep<br />
<br />
Forty fathoms deep he owns<br />
Each sleeping sailor&rsquo;s soggy bones<br />
The legend they call Davy Jones<br />
At forty fathoms deep<br />
<br />
I hold my breath I say a prayer<br />
For all those mates who died<br />
I turn my back on Davy Jones<br />
And cast my fears aside<br />
Raise up my head and kick my feet<br />
And toward the light I go<br />
The heartless jailer left behind<br />
The locker far below<br />
<br />
Oh Forty fathoms deep he walks<br />
With rusty keys his locker locks<br />
Just like he&rsquo;s half asleep he stalks<br />
Forty fathoms deep<br />

Forty fathoms deep he owns<br />

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-26">
<p class="verse">
Upon one summer&rsquo;s morning<br />
I carefully did stray<br />
Down by the Walls of Wapping<br />
Where I met a sailor gay<br />
<br />
Conversing with a young lass<br />
Who seem&rsquo;d to be in pain<br />
Saying, William, when you go<br />
I fear you&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er return again<br />
<br />
My heart is pierced by Cupid<br />
I disdain all glittering gold<br />
There is nothing can console me<br />
But my jolly sailor bold<br />
<br />
His hair it hangs in ringlets<br />
His eyes as black as coal<br />
My happiness attend him<br />
Wherever he may go<br />
<br />
From Tower Hill to Blackwall<br />
I&rsquo;ll wander, weep and moan<br />
All for my jolly sailor<br />
Until he sails home<br />
<br />
My heart is pierced by Cupid<br />
I disdain all glittering gold<br />
There is nothing can console me<br />
But my jolly sailor bold<br />
<br />
My father is a merchant<br />
The truth I now will tell<br />
And in great London City<br />
In opulence doth dwell<br />
<br />
His fortune doth exceed<br />
300,000 gold<br />
And he frowns upon his daughter<br />
Who loves a sailor bold<br />
<br />
A fig for his riches<br />
His merchandise and gold<br />
True love has grafted my heart<br />
Give me my sailor bold<br />
<br />
My heart is pierced by Cupid<br />
I disdain all glittering gold<br />
There is nothing can console me<br />
But my jolly sailor bold<br />
<br />
Should he return in pov&rsquo;rty<br />
From o&rsquo;er the ocean far<br />
To my tender bosom<br />
I&rsquo;ll press my jolly tar<br />
<br />
My sailor is as smiling<br />
As the pleasant month of May<br />
And often we have wandered<br />
Through Ratcliffe Highway<br />
<br />
Many a pretty blooming<br />
Young girl we did behold<br />
Reclining on the bosom<br />
Of her jolly sailor bold<br />
<br />
My heart is pierced by Cupid<br />
I disdain all glittering gold<br />
There is nothing can console me<br />
But my jolly sailor bold<br />
<br />
My name it is Maria<br />
A merchant&rsquo;s daughter fair<br />
And I have left my parents<br />
And three thousand pounds a year<br />
<br />
Come all you pretty fair maids<br />
Whoever you may be<br />
Who love a jolly sailor<br />
That plows the raging sea<br />
<br />
While up aloft in storm<br />
From me his absence mourn<br />
And firmly pray arrive the day<br />
He&rsquo;s never more to roam<br />
<br />
My heart is pierced by Cupid<br />
I disdain all glittering gold<br />
There is nothing can console me<br />
But my jolly sailor bold<br />

We&rsquo;re the pirates of the Black Tide<br />
We will not be ignored<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;re the black-hearted, swashbuckled, never take a shower<br />
Kind of guys obsessed a bit with fame and power<br />
We&rsquo;re deplorable, horrible, scull and cross-bone ridden<br />
Living on the ship where nothing is forbidden<br />
<br />
Yes, we&rsquo;re your worst fear and we know where you sleep<br />
So tucky, tuck in I wouldn&rsquo;t sleep too deep<br />
We&rsquo;re the worst father figure<br />
Figure out how not to scream<br />
We&rsquo;re the pirates of the Black Tide<br />
Hope you have sweet dreams<br />
We&rsquo;re the Pirates of the Black Tide<br />
Hope you have sweet dreams<br />

[Intro: Narrator]<br />
And now it&rsquo;s time for silly songs with Larry<br />
The part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song<br />
<br />
Joining Larry are Pa Grape and Mister Lunt, who together, make up the infamous gang of scallywags &ldquo;The Pirates Who Don&rsquo;t Do Anything&rdquo;<br />
<br />
[Chorus: Pirates]<br />
We are the pirates who don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
We just stay at home and lie around<br />
And if you ask us to do anything<br />
We&rsquo;ll just tell you we don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
[Verse 1: Pa Grape]<br />
Well, I&rsquo;ve never been to Greenland<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Denver<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never buried treasure in St. Louie or St. Paul<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Moscow<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Tampa<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Boston in the fall<br />
<br />
[Chorus: Pirates]<br />
Cause we&rsquo;re the pirates who don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
We just stay at home and lie around<br />
And if you ask us to do anything<br />
We&rsquo;ll just tell you we don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
<br />
[Verse 2: Mr. Lunt]<br />
And I never hoist the mainstay<br />
And I never swab the poop deck<br />
And I never veer to starboard<br />
&rsquo;Cause I never sail at all<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never walked the gangplank<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never owned a parrot<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Boston in the fall<br />
<br />
[Chorus: Pirates]<br />
&rsquo;Cause we&rsquo;re the pirates who don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
We just stay at home and lie around<br />
And if you ask us to do anything<br />
We&rsquo;ll just tell you we don&rsquo;t do anything<br />
[Verse 3: Larry]<br />
Well, I&rsquo;ve never plucked a rooster<br />
And I&rsquo;m not too good at ping pong<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never thrown my mashed potatoes<br />
Up against the wall<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never kissed a chipmunk<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never gotten head lice<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never been to Boston in the fall<br />
<br />
[Spoken Interlude: Pa Grape (Mr. Lunt)]<br />
Huh? What are you talking about? What does a rooster or mashed potatoes have to do with being a pirate?<br />
(Hey, that&rsquo;s right! We&rsquo;re supposed to sing about pirate-y things)<br />
And who&rsquo;s ever kissed a chipmunk? That&rsquo;s just nonsense, why even bring it up? Am I right? What do you think?<br />
(I think you look like Cap&rsquo;n Crunch)<br />
Huh? No I don&rsquo;t<br />
(Do too)<br />
Do not<br />
(You&rsquo;re making me hungry)<br />
That&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;re walking the plank<br />
(Says who?)<br />
Says the Captain<br />
(Oh yeah? Aye, aye, Cap&rsquo;n Crunch! Hee hee hee)<br />
Arrrgh<br />
(Yikes)<br />
<br />
[Verse 4: Larry]<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never licked a spark plug<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never sniffed a stinkbug<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never painted daisies<br />
On a big red rubber ball<br />
And I&rsquo;ve never bathed in yogurt<br />
And I don&rsquo;t look good in leggings<br />
(You just don&rsquo;t get it)<br />
[All:] And we&rsquo;ve never been to Boston in the fall<br />
[Outro]<br />
Pa: Pass the chips! Who’s got the remote?<br />
Larry: Here it is!<br />
Lunt: Time for Geraldo!<br />
Pa: It’s definitely time for Wapner<br />
Lunt: Oh, I don’t like this show<br />
Larry: Hey, look! I found a quarter!<br />

[LONG JOHN]<br />
When I was just a lad looking for my true vocation<br />
My father said &ldquo;Now son, this choice deserves deliberation<br />
Though you could be a doctor or perhaps a financier<br />
My boy, why not consider a more challenging career?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
[PIRATES]<br />
Hey ho ho!<br />
You&rsquo;ll cruise to foreign shores<br />
And you&rsquo;ll keep your mind and body sound<br />
By working out of doors<br />
[LONG JOHN]<br />
True friendship and adventure are what we can&rsquo;t live without<br />
<br />
[PIRATES]<br />
And when you&rsquo;re a professional pirate<br />
<br />
[POLLY]<br />
That&rsquo;s what the job&rsquo;s about<br />
<br />
[LONG JOHN]<br />
(spoken)<br />
Upstage, lads. This is my only number<br />
<br />
(sung)<br />
Now take Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish all despise him<br />
But to the British, he&rsquo;s a hero and they idolize him<br />
It&rsquo;s how you look at buccaneers that makes them bad or good<br />
And I see us as members of a noble brotherhood<br />
<br />
[PIRATES]<br />
Hey ho ho!<br />
We&rsquo;re honorable men<br />
And before we lose our tempers we will<br />
Always count to ten<br />
<br />
[LONG JOHN]<br />
On occasion, there may be someone you have to execute<br />
[PIRATES]<br />
And when you&rsquo;re a professional pirate<br />
<br />
[CLUELESS]<br />
You don&rsquo;t have to wear a suit<br />
<br />
&#x2026;What?<br />
<br />
[MONTY]<br />
I could have been a surgeon, I like taking things apart<br />
<br />
[POLLY]<br />
I could have been a lawyer, but I just had too much heart<br />
<br />
[CLUELESS]<br />
I could have been in politics &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve always been a big spender<br />
<br />
[BLACK-EYED PEA]<br />
(spoken)<br />
And me, I could&rsquo;ve been a contender<br />
<br />
[LONG JOHN]<br />
Some say that pirates steal and should be feared and hated<br />
I say we&rsquo;re victims of bad press that&rsquo;s all exaggerated<br />
We never stab you in the back, we never lie or cheat<br />
We&rsquo;re just, in fact, the nicest guy you ever want to meet<br />
(spoken)<br />
Tell the truth, lad. Do you really think the Captain and the Squire are planning to share the treasure with the likes of us? Can&rsquo;t hear ya. No? And we being the rightful owners, Flint&rsquo;s own crew, who shed our blood getting it here. Join us lad. Donate your compass to the treasure hunt and get a full share!<br />
<br />
[LONG JONG and PIRATES]<br />
Hey ho ho!<br />
It&rsquo;s one for all for one<br />
And we&rsquo;ll share and share alike with you<br />
And love you like a son<br />
We&rsquo;re gentlemen of fortune and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re bound to be<br />
And when you&rsquo;re a professional pirate-<br />
<br />
[LONG JOHN]<br />
You&rsquo;ll be honest, brave, and free!<br />
The soul of decency!<br />
You&rsquo;ll be loyal and fair and on the square<br />
But most importantly<br />
<br />
[LONG JOHN and PIRATES]<br />
When you&rsquo;re a professional pirate<br />
You are always in the best of company!<br />

There are hungers as strong as the wind and tides<br />
Yo ho heave ho<br />
And those buccaneers drowned their sins in rum<br />
The devil himself would have to call them scum<br />
Every man aboard would have killed his mate<br />
For a bag of guineas or a piece of eight<br />
(A piece of eight)<br />
(A piece of eight)<br />
<br />
Five, six, seven, eight!<br />
<br />
Hoola wacka! Oola wacka! Something not right<br />
Many wicked icky things gonna happen tonight<br />
Hoola wacka! Oola wacka! Sailor man beware<br />
When there&rsquo;s money in the ground there&rsquo;s murder in the air<br />
(Murder in the air)<br />
<br />
One more time now<br />
<br />
Shiver my timbers, shiver my bones<br />
Yo ho heave ho<br />
There are secrets that sleep with old Davy Jones<br />
Yo ho heave ho<br />
<br />
When the mainsail&rsquo;s set and the anchor&rsquo;s weighed<br />
There&rsquo;s no turning back from any course that&rsquo;s laid<br />
And when greed and villainy sail the sea<br />
You can bet your boots there&rsquo;ll be treachery<br />
Shiver my timbers, shiver my sails<br />
Dead men tell no tales<br />

[Verse 1]<br />
Oh the whiskey is floating won&rsquo;t stay in ye glass<br />
I&rsquo;m weightless and spinning and drunk off me ass<br />
Oh the whiskey is floating in a sphere o&rsquo;er me head<br />
If we don&rsquo;t clear this wormhole we&rsquo;re surely be dead<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
So reach for the whiskey boys reach for the stars<br />
They won&rsquo;t stop us drinking on Venus or Mars<br />
So reach for the whiskey boys reach for the sky<br />
For the vacuum of space sucks the bottles all dry<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Oh infinite booty awaits us in space<br />
We&rsquo;ll pillage and plunder with fervor and grace<br />
That&rsquo;s what my astronomical unit is for<br />
Let&rsquo;s party where no one has partied before<br />
<br />

Alone in the cockpit I gaze at the stars<br />
I drink and I think of my home<br />
(He thinks of his home)<br />
Of my home<br />

Our thrusters are the hottest that you&rsquo;ve ever felt<br />
They might just unbuckle your asteroid belt<br />
We&rsquo;re honing our moonwalking skills as we speak<br />
We&rsquo;ll dance on Uranus by this time next week<br />

[Verse 1]<br />
Well me father often told me when I was just a lad<br />
A sailor&rsquo;s life is very hard, the food is always bad<br />
But now I&rsquo;ve joined the navy, I&rsquo;m aboard a man-o-war<br />
And now I&rsquo;ve found a sailor ain&rsquo;t a sailor any more<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Don&rsquo;t haul on the rope, don&rsquo;t climb up the mast<br />
If you see a sailing ship it might be your last<br />
Just get your civvies ready for another run-ashore<br />
A sailor ain&rsquo;t a sailor, ain&rsquo;t a sailor anymore<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
Well the killick of our mess he says we had it soft<br />
It wasn&rsquo;t like that in his day when we were up aloft<br />
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what&rsquo;s a hammock for?<br />
Swinging from the deckhead, or lying on the floor?<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Don&rsquo;t haul on the rope, don&rsquo;t climb up thе mast<br />

A sailor ain&rsquo;t a sailor, ain&rsquo;t a sailor anymore<br />
<br />
[Verse 3]<br />
They gave us an engine that first went up and down<br />
Then with more technology the engine went around<br />
We know our steam and diesels but what&rsquo;s a mainyard for?<br />
A stoker ain&rsquo;t a stoker with a shovel anymore<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Don&rsquo;t haul on the rope, don&rsquo;t climb up the mast<br />

Two cans of beer a day and that&rsquo;s your bleeding lot<br />
And now we&rsquo;ve got an extra one because they stopped The Tot<br />
So we&rsquo;ll put on our civvy-clothes find a pub ashore<br />
A sailor&rsquo;s just a sailor just like he was before<br />
[Chorus]<br />
Don&rsquo;t haul on the rope, don&rsquo;t climb up the mast<br />
If you see a sailing ship it might be your last<br />
Just get your civvies ready for another run-ashore<br />
A sailor ain&rsquo;t a sailor, ain&rsquo;t a sailor anymore<br />
Don&rsquo;t haul on the rope, don&rsquo;t climb up the mast<br />

There&rsquo;s not a thing wrong with this ship<br />

If if this vessel it were mine<br />
Nothing unrealistic or too drastic or severe<br />
Just some subtle tweaks to improve the atmosphere!<br />

I would have a great big deck<br />
Plated in solid gold!<br />
&rsquo;Cause being teased about my little deck<br />
Is really gettin&rsquo; old! (happens a lot)<br />
I&rsquo;d sail from south tortuga<br />
All the way up to Quebec<br />

Let&rsquo;s see, uh<br />
I&rsquo;d get rid of all the water<br />
From down in the ballast hole (but we&rsquo;ll tip over!)<br />
And replace it with some good dark rum<br />
Where it can stay nice and cold!<br />
Every man aboard the ship can drink<br />
Until he&rsquo;s had his fill<br />
And the only rude we&rsquo;d enforce<br />
Is that noone&rsquo;s allowed to spill!<br />

And find something better than the wind (what?)<br />
Perhaps some sort of intermittent combustion engine<br />
With reciprocating pistons<br />
And a fuel source based on heat!<br />
We could - hey! - woah, woah, woah!<br />

Oh you hear a lot of stories &rsquo;bout the sailors and their sport<br />
About how every sailor has a girl in every port<br />
But if you added 2 and 2 you’d figure out right quick<br />
It&rsquo;s just because the girls all have a lad on every ship<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
It’s often times a man will leave you broken with dismay<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />

There&rsquo;s other things to twiddle when the men have sailed away<br />
Lucky Annie was a lady who&rsquo;d been pleased by many men<br />
They all would sail away but then they&rsquo;d come right back again<br />
But if they never sailed her way she really didn&rsquo;t care<br />
Cause I know that you don&rsquo;t need a man to twiddle under there<br />
<br />

And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />

Saber had her lovers, they came in at every door<br />
You could even say that she was really quite a whore<br />
But when she needs some pleasing, she knows just where to go<br />
I grab my good friend Madam Rouge and we go down below<br />
<br />

And it’s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />

And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />

There&rsquo;s other things to twiddle when the men have sailed away<br />
There was a time when Rouge she found the sailor men a bore<br />
Each new one was more tiresome than the one she had before<br />
Now she finds more joy in breeches than she ever did of old<br />
I’m more fond of their bulges when they&rsquo;re pouches full of gold<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
It&rsquo;s often times a man will leave you broken with dismay<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
There&rsquo;s other things to twiddle when the men have sailed away<br />
<br />
Why the boys would look at her, it puzzled poor Flint Locke<br />
She would sit and smile and nod and let them brag and talk<br />
But if they tried to touch her well she&rsquo;d put them on the run<br />
Cause why would I need a lover when I&rsquo;ve got myself a gun<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
It&rsquo;s often times a man will leave you broken with dismay<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
There&rsquo;s other things to twiddle when the men have sailed away<br />
So next time you&rsquo;re with a lady and she takes you to her bed<br />
Be sure to please her well, and remember what we&rsquo;ve said<br />
For if you do not treat her right then know that this is true<br />
Us ladies all can have our fun without involving you<br />
<br />
[Chorus x2]<br />
And it&rsquo;s Twiddle ee ai dee ai dee ai<br />
Twiddle ee ai dee ei<br />
It&rsquo;s often times a man will leave you broken with dismay<br />

<p class="verse">
No future was there in London for a poor man&rsquo;s son like me<br />
So I left my home and I went to seek my fortune on the sea<br />
I signed aboard a merchant ship bound for the west indies<br />
And six weeks out we tapped into the winds of piracy<br />
<br />
There we sails on the horizon and we tried to make a run<br />
And when we saw that black flag then our running it was done<br />
And when those pirates boarded us they told us one by one<br />
&ldquo;You can die or join our crew me boys<br />
Time flies whеn you&rsquo;re having rum!&rdquo;<br />
Time flies whеn you&rsquo;re having rum me boys<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
When you&rsquo;re sailing under the black flag<br />
And you&rsquo;re firing all your guns<br />
When you take a spanish treasure ship<br />
You divide by the rule of thumb<br />
Our voyage will be over soon enough<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
<br />
With a pistol to my forehead<br />
Then my choice was all too clear<br />
I took leave of that merchant ship and became a buccaneer<br />
And though they spared my life I think that if the truth be told<br />
I joined them for the promise of<br />
Adventure, rum and gold<br />
<br />
The quartermaster handed me a cutlass and a gun<br />
And as I signed their articles the captain told me &ldquo;Son<br />
Us gentlemen of fortune live life fast and on the run<br />
So step right up and take your share<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum me boys<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
When you&rsquo;re sailing under the black flag<br />
And you&rsquo;re firing all your guns<br />
When you take a spanish treasure ship<br />
You divide by the rule of thumb<br />
Our voyage will be over soon enough<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
For two long years I sailed with them<br />
Around the Spanish Main<br />
And capture ships from Portugal<br />
From England, France and Spain<br />
We took what we could and we gave none back<br />
For that&rsquo;s the pirate&rsquo;s code<br />
And in our wake the Caribbean Sea ran red with blood<br />
<br />
The admiralty in London sent a fleet to hunt us down<br />
A traitor in Port Royal told them where we could be found<br />
They surrounded us in Nassau, the captain shouted<br />
&ldquo;Let &lsquo;em come! The fight will be over soon enough<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum me boys<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
When you&rsquo;re sailing under the black flag<br />
And you&rsquo;re firing all your guns<br />
When you take a spanish treasure ship<br />
You divide by the rule of thumb<br />
The voyage will be over soon enough<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
<br />
We ran the red flag up and then we readied all our guns<br />
No quarter would we give and in turn expected none<br />
We got off one good broadside<br />
But outnumbered ten to one<br />
They took out half our crew<br />
And then our pirating was done<br />
They took us back to London Town nder key and lock<br />
The hangman&rsquo;s noose was swinging at the execution dock<br />
The captain turned and said to me, &ldquo;We had fine sailing son<br />
The voyage it was over all too soon<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum me boys<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
When you&rsquo;re sailing under the black flag<br />
And you&rsquo;re firing all your guns<br />
When you take a spanish treasure ship<br />
You divide by the rule of thumb<br />
Our voyage will be over soon enough<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
<br />
Now as you&rsquo;ve listened to this tale by know<br />
I&rsquo;m sure you have surmised<br />
That I slipped the hangman&rsquo;s cable<br />
And escaped him with my life<br />
But how I got away<br />
That&rsquo;s another story son<br />
My voyages they aren’t over yet<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum!<br />
<br />
<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum me boys<br />
Time flies when you&rsquo;re having rum<br />
When you&rsquo;re sailing under the black flag<br />
And you&rsquo;re firing all your guns<br />

He was a nice young sailor lad, as green as green could be<br />
When he first joined our crew for a life of piracy<br />
When a storm nearly capsized us, he was thrown from the ship<br />
Stranded on Hispaniola, right there on the western tip<br />
When the crew next saw him they could not believe their eyes<br />
There was little left of the young man that one could recognize<br />
His hair was long a braided, and he looked ready for war<br />
But he smiled and said &ldquo; Hello mates. I&rsquo;m your new bokor<br />
<br />
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes<br />
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose<br />
When he starts his chanting we don&rsquo;t always understand<br />
But we always listen to him, cause he&rsquo;s our voodoo man<br />
The captain said &rdquo;Now listen boys, I think we should turn back<br />
There&rsquo;s a storm a brewing and that beast is building fast.&ldquo;<br />
The bokur said &rdquo;Just wait a minute and Captain keep your course&ldquo;<br />
And he went back to his cabin but the storm it just got worse<br />
<br />
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash<br />
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash<br />
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door<br />
And when we started to relax, it started up once more<br />
<br />
He rushed out and said &rdquo;We&rsquo;ll need every inch of sail.&ldquo;<br />
And a swath of clear blue sky split the monstrous gale<br />
The wind filed every sail and tightened every line<br />
As we passed we saw the storm crashed back in behind<br />
<br />
Now he wears more tattoos than clothes<br />
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose<br />
When he starts his chanting we don&rsquo;t always understand<br />
But we always listen to him, cause he&rsquo;s our voodoo man<br />
<br />
While hunting down a merchant ship around the rocky shore<br />
We came around the island to a massive Man o&rsquo; War<br />
The captain said &rdquo; Now listen boys. We&rsquo;re about to meet our doom.&ldquo;<br />
And the bokor shouted &rdquo;Never fear&ldquo;<br />
And he ran down to his room<br />
We heard howls, and moans, and a bang, and a crash<br />
We saw thick black smoke and a fiery flash<br />
We could smell the lighting and we just stared at his door<br />
And when we started to relax, it started up once more<br />
<br />
&rdquo;Fire two shots!&ldquo; he shouted and they went off right on cue<br />
Both shots found their target and their powder hold it blew<br />
The Man o&rsquo; War bust into flames and it began to pitch<br />
And we stole enough from her to make sure we were rich<br />
<br />
He still wears more tattoos than clothes<br />
With a ring on every finger and bone in his nose<br />
When he starts his chanting we don&rsquo;t try to understand<br />
But we always listen to him, cause he&rsquo;s our voodoo man<br />
We always listen to him, cause he&rsquo;s our voodoo man<br />
We always listen to him, cause he&rsquo;s our voodoo man<br />

There once was a ship that put to sea<br />
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea<br />
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down<br />
O blow, my bully boys, blow (Huh!)<br />

Soon may the Wellerman come<br />

One day, when the tonguin&rsquo; is done<br />
We&rsquo;ll take our leave and go<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
She had not been two weeks from shore<br />
When down on her, a right whale bore<br />

He&rsquo;d take that whale in tow (Huh!)<br />

Before the boat had hit the water<br />
The whale&rsquo;s tail came up and caught her<br />
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br />
When she dived down low (Huh!)<br />
